Designed an Automated Plant Watering System, with the aid of a moisture sensor, water pump, and a micro-controller. This program was written in Java using the IntelliJ IDE, along with components like the Arduino Groove Board to constantly check the moisture of the plant and decide whether to water it or not based on the given conditions.
